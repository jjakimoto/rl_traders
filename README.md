# Reinforcement Learning for Trading
Implementations of Reinforcement Learning for Algorithmic Trading with PyTorch
## Installation
```
python setup.py install
```

After instllation, you can use the  library as `rl_traders`.
To use this library, it is required to install [`torch_utils`](https://github.com/jjakimoto/torch_utils)
and [`btbot`](https://github.com/jjakimoto/btbot).
